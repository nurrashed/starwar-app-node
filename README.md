## App description

I have created a basic web page using HTML/CSS/Javascript that displays
Star Wars characters and provides information about them.


1. It shows all the Star Wars characters by their name. I Use swapi (Star Wars API) for this.
   

2. It display additional information about the characters when their names are hover-over. The user should also be able to hide this information again. 


## Setup


If you choose to clone this one you will need to install [Node.js] - npm install node

You can then execute `npm start` in your terminal while inside the project directory to launch the application in the web with auto refresh when you save file changes.
